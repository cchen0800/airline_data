Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis
Data Analytics Project: Passenger Satisfaction in Airline Survey
Welcome to my first data analytics project! In this project, I aim to demonstrate the data analysis process by exploring factors that drive passenger satisfaction in an airline survey dataset. Through this project, I will showcase various steps involved in data analysis, including data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information from an airline passenger satisfaction survey. It includes the following columns:

Gender: Gender of the passengers (Female, Male)
Customer Type: The customer type (Loyal customer, disloyal customer)
Age: The actual age of the passengers
Type of Travel: Purpose of the flight of the passengers (Personal Travel, Business Travel)
Class: Travel class in the plane of the passengers (Business, Eco, Eco Plus)
Flight distance: The flight distance of this journey
Inflight wifi service: Satisfaction level of the inflight wifi service (0: Not Applicable; 1-5)
Departure/Arrival time convenient: Satisfaction level of Departure/Arrival time convenient
Ease of Online booking: Satisfaction level of online booking
Gate location: Satisfaction level of Gate location
Food and drink: Satisfaction level of Food and drink
Online boarding: Satisfaction level of online boarding
Seat comfort: Satisfaction level of Seat comfort
Inflight entertainment: Satisfaction level of inflight entertainment
On-board service: Satisfaction level of On-board service
Leg room service: Satisfaction level of Leg room service
Baggage handling: Satisfaction level of baggage handling
Check-in service: Satisfaction level of Check-in service
Inflight service: Satisfaction level of inflight service
Cleanliness: Satisfaction level of Cleanliness
Departure Delay in Minutes: Minutes delayed when departure
Arrival Delay in Minutes: Minutes delayed when Arrival
Satisfaction: Airline satisfaction level (Satisfaction, neutral, or dissatisfaction)



# Project Plan
To analyze the factors driving passenger satisfaction and create a predictive model, I will follow these steps:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Load the dataset, examine its structure, and handle missing values.
Perform descriptive statistics to gain initial insights into the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the data using charts, graphs, and plots to identify patterns and relationships.
Investigate correlations between independent variables and passenger satisfaction.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might provide additional insights.
Encode categorical variables into numerical values.
Feature Selection:

Select the most influential features using statistical tests and feature importance scores.
Model Development:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose evaluation metrics and experiment with various machine learning algorithms.
Train, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate models based on performance.
Interpretation and Insights:

Analyze model coefficients or feature importances to identify drivers of passenger satisfaction.
Conduct statistical analysis to validate relationships between significant features and satisfaction.
Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on findings.
Predictive Model Deployment:

Retrain the best-performing model on the entire dataset for maximum performance.
Save the trained model and create a user-friendly interface or API for predictions.
Continuously monitor and update the model as needed.
Conclusion
This project aims to demonstrate the data analysis process, from initial exploration to model interpretation. Through this journey, I hope to uncover valuable insights about passenger satisfaction in the airline industry. I am excited to embark on this data analytics project and look forward to sharing my findings and lessons learned along the way.
